# gatsby-transformer-markdown-wasm

This is a test to see if it makes sense to have a [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) based markdown parser for Gatsby.

*THIS IS NOWHERE NEAR READY TO ACTUALLY USE*

## Instructions

1) Install `wasm-pack` by following [these instructions](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)
2) Run `make build` to build the wasm bundle.
3) Run `make test` to make sure everything looks good.
4) Run `node index.js` to see the use-case of this package.
